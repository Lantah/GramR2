## Read before creating an issue

In general, we close any issues that are
* unactionable (fill the template below under "Description")
* questions best served elsewhere

We have a small community of people that manages issues, and we want to ensure that the issues that remain open are high quality (so we actually get around to implementing them!).

### I have a question!

The GramR issues repository is meant for reporting bugs and feature requests related to GramR's implementation.

If you have a question, we would recommend that you take a look at Stellar's [developer portal][1], where you'll find comprehensive documentation related to Stellar.

### I'd like to request new functionality in GramR!

First, you have to ask whether what you're trying to file is an issue related to Stellar's Protocol
OR if it's related to `GramR`, the C++ implementation that's in this repository.

Typically a request that changes how the core protocol works (such as adding a new operation, changing the way transactions work, etc) is best filed in the [Stellar Protocol repository][4].

However, if your change is related to the implementation (say you'd like to see a new command line
flag or HTTP command added to GramR), this is the place.

* Please check existing and closed issues in Github! You may have to remove the `is:open` filter.
* Check the [releases](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/releases) page to see if your request has already been added in a later release.
