## Read before creating an issue

In general, we close any issues that are
* unactionable (fill the template below under "Description")
* questions best served elsewhere

We have a small community of people that manages issues, and we want to ensure that the issues that remain open are high quality (so we actually get around to implementing them!).


### I'd like to report a bug or feature request related to the documentation!

First, consider that Stellar's documentation is spread across multiple repositories, and this repository only pertains to docs related to `gramr`, i.e. if it's in the `docs` folder. Please check to see if the source of the document you're looking at resides in this repository *before filing an issue*.

## Description

### Explain in detail the incorrect or additional documentation you'd like to see.

*Be descriptive, including any suggestions you may have with regard to the layout and content of our docs*.

### Please include any links to where our docs are hosted on our Developer Portal

*It makes it much easier for us to determine additional changes across various other repositories. Usually these are hosted at https://www.lantah.com/developers*.

### Additional context
*Add any other context about the docs report here, including any gists or attachments that would make it easier to understand the bug or enhancement you're describing*.
