<h1>GramR</h1>
</div>


GramR is a replicated state machine that maintains a local copy of a cryptographic ledger and processes transactions against it, in consensus with a set of peers.
It implements the federated consensus protocol originally developed by [Stellar](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/src/scp/readme.md).
It is written in C++14 and runs on Linux, OSX and Windows.
Currently, you may see many references to the original Stellar protocol within this code, including some URLs. Please be patient while Lantah and the community work towards further building this project. Feel free to contribute!
